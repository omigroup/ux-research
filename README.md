# UX Research Working Group DRAFT 

This group is newly formed and will resume working through our README, and repo on November 1, 2022 at 16:00 UTC. You can add your ideas for what we should work on here: https://github.com/omigroup/ux-research/issues/12

## About: 
Description of working working group coming soon. 

## How you can get involved: TBD - see this milestone: https://github.com/omigroup/ux-research/milestone/1
- The group meets on Tuesday (for now) every 2 week(s) at 16:00 UTC
- We might track our active tickets with our [Github Projects Kanban Backlog](../../projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen) but haven't really started using the backlog yet. 
- A great way to track work is using [Milestones](../../milestones) which makes it easier to track progress based on desired outcomes and objectives.
- We discuss our efforts using [github discussions](../../discussions) and in the discord channel `omi-uxresearch`
- Any questions? Contact the designated working group lead Shadow @Elirudite

Our Commitments: 
- We are still very new and need all the help we can get. We haven't created too many processes just yet. 
- TBD: We might have a group retrospective on the 4th ___ of every month to reflect on what is going well, what could be improved, and what we will do differently next cycle. 
- We will not be recording our meetings (unless you can attend and record for us)
- We will create an agenda before our recurring meetings, and ask volunteers to take notes during our meeting.
